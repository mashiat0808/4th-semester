Following an introductory chapter, Chapter 1, the book is organized into four parts:
Part One: Symmetric Ciphers: Provides a survey of symmetric encryption, including
classical and modern algorithms. The emphasis is on the two most important algorithms,
the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). This
part also addresses message authentication and key management.
Part Two: Public-Key Encryption and Hash Functions: Provides a survey of public-
key algorithms, including RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adelman) and elliptic curve. It also covers
public-key applications, including digital signatures and key exchange.
Part Three: Network Security Practice: Examines the use of cryptographic algorithms
and security protocols to provide security over networks and the Internet. Topics covered
include user authentication, e-mail, IP security, and Web security.
Part Four: System Security: Deals with security facilities designed to protect a
computer system from security threats, including intruders, viruses, and worms. This part
also looks at firewall technology.
